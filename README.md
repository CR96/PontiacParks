# Pontiac Parks

## A visual representation of park accessibility data collected in [Pontiac, Michigan.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pontiac,+MI/)

This project supplements research performed in the summer of 2017 as part of Health Science 405: Community Engaged Research Training, a course offered through the  [School of Health Sciences at Oakland University.](https://oakland.edu/shs/)

Images and geolocation data for this project were collected with a [Garmin Oregon 650t](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/113548) and organized using [Google Earth Pro 7.3](https://www.google.com/earth/desktop/).
